# 5 min Markdown tutorial

Markdown is usually writing documents for the web. It includes some of the basic syntax shown below.

# Headings

There are six types of headings, denoted by hashes. The largest of all being `#` while the smallest being `######`.

For example, if you write the following line in your markdown file,

```md
# Heading 1
```

it will give,

# Heading 1

as an output.

Similaraly,

```md
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6
```

will give an output,

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

# Paragraphs

Paragraphs are written without any syntax. They are just written like,

```md
This is a paragraph
```

The above will give an output, 

This is a paragraph

> Always remember to leave one line before changing the paragraph.

For example,

```md
This is paragraph 1
This is paragraph 2
```

The above will output to:

This is paragraph 1This is paragraph 2

On the other hand,

```md
This is paragraph 1

This is paragraph 2
```

will give an output

This is paragraph 1

This is paragraph 2

# Formatting texts

## Bold

If you want to bolden text, just put the text between four `*`. For example,

```md
**This is bold**
```

will give,

**This is bold**

> Headings are bold by default. You don't need to put them between four `*`.

## Italic

If you want to use an italic text, put the text between two `*`. For example,

```md
*This is italic*
```

will give,

*This is italic*

## Links

When using links, put the link text inside `[]` immediately followed by the link location inside `()`.

For example,

```md
[Google](https://google.com)
```

will give

[Google](https://google.com)

## Images

Inserting images has the same method like that of links, starting with a `!`. Inside the `[]` you need to write the image alt text, immediately followed by the image link inside `()`.

For example,

```md
![Google](https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png)
```

will give

![Google](https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png)
