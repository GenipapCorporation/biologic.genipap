# Genipap Biologic Documentation

This documentation will help you go through the process of posting an article on <a href='https://biologic.genipap.tk' target="_blank">Genipap Biologic</a>, Your Free Portable Biology Encyclopedia.

The process shown here is only temporary. Our development team, is creating a UI for writing and uploading files in the Website itself. Until then, you'll have to use the GitHub interface to write your articles.

First and foremost you'll need to have a <a href='https://github.com' target="_blank">GitHub</a> account. GitHub is where you'll be writing and editing your articles or articles by other contributors. The project directory for Genipap Biologic is located at [https://github.com/GenipapCorporation/biologic.genipap/](https://github.com/GenipapCorporation/biologic.genipap/). Once you have created an account, go to the project directory and follow the following steps:

## 1. Go to the `articles` folder

Once you've gone to the `articles` folder (usually the first folder), you'll find files ending with the extension `.mdx`. Create a new file with the name of your article, with a `.mdx` extention. While naming your file, follow the article nomenclature.

### Article nomenclature

The spaces in your title has to be replaced with an underscore `_`. If your article is titled *Plants and flowers*, you need to name your file as `Plants_and_flowers.mdx`. Another example, for an article titled *Human evolution*, the file needs to be saved as `Human_evolution.mdx`.

> Remember, if you create an article file in any other folder other than the `articles` folder in the external or root directory, your post might not be available on the site.

## 2. Submitting the article
