# Genipap Biologic Documentation

This documentation will help you go through the process of posting an article on <a href='https://biologic.genipap.tk' target="_blank">Genipap Biologic</a>, Your Free Portable Biology Encyclopedia.

The process shown here is only temporary. Our development team, is creating a UI for writing and uploading files in the Website itself. Until then, you'll have to use the GitHub interface to write your articles.

First and foremost you'll need to have a <a href='https://github.com' target="_blank">GitHub</a> account. GitHub is where you'll be writing and editing your articles or articles by other contributors. The project directory for Genipap Biologic is located at [https://github.com/GenipapCorporation/biologic.genipap/](https://github.com/GenipapCorporation/biologic.genipap/). Once you have created an account, go to the project directory and follow the following steps:

## 1. Go to the `articles` folder

Once you've gone to the `articles` folder (usually the first folder), you'll find files ending with the extension `.mdx`. Create a new file with the name of your article, with a `.mdx` extention. While naming your file, follow the article nomenclature.

[Click on this link](https://github.com/GenipapCorporation/biologic.genipap/new/main/articles/) to skip locating the directory and immediately start writing the article.

### Article nomenclature

The spaces in your title has to be replaced with an underscore `_`. If your article is titled *Plants and flowers*, you need to name your file as `Plants_and_flowers.mdx`. Another example, for an article titled *Human evolution*, the file needs to be saved as `Human_evolution.mdx`.

> Remember, if you create an article file in any other folder other than the `articles` folder in the external or root directory, your post might not be available on the site.

## 2. Writing the article

The article is written in Markdown format. If you're new to markdown, we suggest you see the <a href='https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/' target="_blank">getting started</a>, and <a href='https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/' target="_blank">basic syntax</a> modules.

You can also see the [5 min Markdown tutorial](5-min-markdown-tutorial) created by us. That might be of some help.

## 3. Submitting the article

After you've written the article, scroll to the bottom of the GitHub interface where you've written the markdown and click on the `Propse new file` button. After which, you'll be directed to a page where you'll have to click the `Create pull request` button. Once you've done that, your article will be available on the Website within 5-10 minutes.

### Error while submitting

In case you don't find your article on our website, please recheck your file nomenclature. Even after that if your file isin't present on the website, raise an issue [here](https://github.com/GenipapCorporation/biologic.genipap/issues/new).
