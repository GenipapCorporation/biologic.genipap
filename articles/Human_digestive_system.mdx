Food is one of the basic requirements of all living organisms. The major components of our food are carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Vitamins and minerals are also required but in small quantities. Food provides energy and organic materials for growth and repair of tissues. The water we take in, plays an important role in metabolic processes and also prevents dehydration of the body. Biomacromolecules in food cannot be utilized by our body in their original form. They have to be broken down and converted into simple substances in the digestive system. *This process of conversion of complex food substances to simple absorbable forms is called **digestion** and is carried out by our digestive system by mechanical and biochemical methods*.

# Digestive system

The human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and the necessary associated glands.

## Alimentary canal

The alimentary canal begins with an anterior opening, the mouth, and it opens out posteriorly through the anus. The mouth leads to the buccal cavity or oral cavity. The oral cavity has a number of teeth and a muscular tongue. Each tooth is embedded in a socket of jaw bone. This type of attachment is called **thecodont**. Majority of mammals including human beings forms two sets of teeth during their life, a set of temporary milk or deciduous teeth replaced by a set of permanent or adult teeth. This type of dentition is called **diphyodont**. An adult human has 32 permanent teeth which are of four different types, heterodont dentition, namely, incisors, I, canine, C, premolars, PM, and molars, M. Arrangement of teeth in each half of the upper and lower jaw in the order *I*, *C*, *PM*, and *M* is represented by a dental formula which in humans is 2123/2123. The hard chewing surface of the teeth, made up of enamel, helps in the mastication, chewing, of food. The tongue is a freely moveable muscular organ attached to the floor of the oral cavity by the frenulum. The upper surface of the tongue has small projections called papillae, some of which bear taste buds.

The oral cavity leads into a short pharynx, which serves as a common passage for both food and air. The esophagus, and the trachea, wind pipe, open into the pharynx. A cartilaginous flap called epiglottis prevents the entry of food into the glottis – opening of the wind pipe – during swallowing. The esophagus is a thin, long tube which extends posteriorly passing through the neck, thorax and diaphragm and leads to a *J* shaped bag like structure called stomach. A muscular sphincter, gastro-esophageal, regulates the esophagus into the stomach. The stomach located in the upper-left portion of the abdominal cavity, has four major parts – a **cardiac** portion into which the esophagus opens, a **fundic** region, body, the main central region, and a **pyloric** portion which opens into the first part of the small intestine. Small intestine is distinguishable into three regions, a *C*-shaped duodenum, a long coiled middle portion, jejunum, and a highly coiled ileum. The opening of the stomach into the duodenum is guarded by a muscular *pyloric sphincter*. Ileum opens into the large intestine. It consists of caecum, colon, and rectum. Caecum is a small blind sac which hosts some symbiotic microorganisms. A narrow finger-like tubular projection, the *vermiform appendix*, which is a vestigial organ arises from the caecum. The caecum opens into the colon. The caecum is divided into four regions – an *ascending*, a *descending*, a *transverse* and sigmoid colon, *the last part of the colon*. The descending part opens into the rectum which further opens out through the anus.

The wall of the alimentary canal from esophagus to rectum possesses four layers, namely, serosa, muscularis, sub-mucosa and mucosa. Serosa is the outermost layer and is made up of a thin mesothelium, epithelium of visceral organs, with some connective tissues. Muscularis is formed by smooth muscles usually arranged in an inner circular and an outer longitudinal layer. An oblique muscle layer may be present in some regions. The sub-mucosa is formed from loose connective tissues containing nerves blood and lymph vessels. In duodenum, glands are also present in submucosa. The innermost layer lining the lumen of the alimentary canal is the mucosa. This layer forms irregular folds, rugae, in the stomach and small finger-like projections called ***villi***, in the small intestine. The cells lining the villi produce numerous microscopic projections called *microvilli* giving a brush border appearance. These modifications increase the surface area enormously. Villi are supplied with a network of capillaries and a large lymph vessel called the lacteal. Mucosal epithelium has goblet cells which secrete mucus that help in lubrication. Mucosa also forms glands in the stomach, gastric glands, and crypts in between the bases of villi in the intestine, *Crypts of Liberkuhn*. All the four layers show modifications in different parts of the alimentary canal.

## Digestive glands

The digestive glands associated with the alimentary canal include the salivary glands, the liver and the pancreas.
	
Saliva is mainly produced by three pairs of salivary glands, the parotids, cheek, the sub-maxillary/sub-mandibular, lower jaw, and the sub-lingual, *below the tongue*. These glands situated just outside the buccal cavity secrete salivary juice into the buccal cavity.
	
Liver is the largest gland of the body weighing about 1.2 to 1.5 kg in an adult human. It is situated in the abdominal cavity, just below the diaphragm and has two lobes. The hepatic lobules are the structural and functional units of liver containing hepatic cells arranged in the form of cords. Each lobule is covered by a thin connective tissue sheath called the *Glisson's capsule*. The bile secreted by the hepatic cells passes through the hepatic ducts and is stored and concentrated in a thin muscular sac called the gall bladder. The duct of gall bladder, cystic duct, along with the hepatic duct from the liver forms the common bile duct. The bile duct and the pancreatic duct open together into the duodenum as the common hepato-pancreatic duct which is guarded by a sphincter called the *sphincter of Oddi*.

The pancreas is a compound, *both exocrine and endocrine*, elongated organ situated between the limbs of the C-shaped duodenum. The exocrine portion secretes an alkaline pancreatic juice containing enzymes and the endocrine portion secretes hormones, insulin and glucagon.

# Digestion of food

The process of digestion is accompanied by mechanical and chemical processes.

The buccal cavity performs two major functions, mastication of food and facilitation of swallowing. The teeth and the tongue with the help of saliva masticate and mix up the food thoroughly. Mucus in the saliva helps in lubricating and adhering the masticated food particles into a **bolus**. The bolus then is conveyed into the pharynx and then into the esophagus by swallowing or **deglutition**. The bolus further passes down through the esophagus through successive waves of muscular contractions called peristalsis. The *gastro-esophageal sphincter*, controls the passage of food into the stomach. The saliva secreted into the oral cavity contains electrolytes, *sodium ion*, *potassium ion*, *chloride ion*, and *bicarbonate ions* along with enzymes, salivary amylase and lysozyme. The chemical process of digestion is initiated in the oral cavity by the hydrolytic action of the carbohydrate splitting enzyme, the salivary amylase. About 30 percent of the starch is hydrolyzed here by this enzyme, *optimum pH 6.8*, into a disaccharide – maltose. Lysozyme present in saliva acts as an antibacterial agent that prevents infections.

The mucosa of stomach has gastric glands. Gastric glands have tree major types of cells namely –

- Mucus neck cells which secrete mucus;
- Peptic or chief cells which secrete the proenzyme pepsinogen; and
- Parietal or oxyntic cells which secrete HCl and intrinsic factor, *factor essential for the absorption of vitamin B12*.

The stomach stores food for about 4-5 hours. The food mixes thoroughly with the acidic gastric juice of the stomach by the churning movements of its muscular wall and is called the **chyme**. The proenzyme pepsinogen, on exposure to hydrochloric acid, gets converted into active enzyme pepsin, *the proteolytic enzyme of the stomach*. Pepsin converts proteins into *proteoses* and *peptones*, *peptides*. The mucus and bicarbonates present in the gastric juice play a very important role in lubrication and protection of mucosal epithelium from excoriation by highly concentrated hydrochloric acid. HCl provides the acidic pH of 1.8, optimal for pepsins. Rennin is a proteolytic enzyme found in gastric juice of infants which helps in the digestion of milk proteins. Small amounts of lipases are also secreted by gastric glands.

Various types of movements are generated by the muscularis layer of the small intestine. These movements help in the thorough mixing up of food with the various secretions in the intestine thereby facilitating digestion. The bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal juice are released into the small intestine. Pancreatic juice and bile are released through the hepato-pancreatic duct. The pancreatic juice contains inactive enzymes – *trypsinogen*, *chymotrypsinogen*, *procarboxypeptidases*, *amylases*, *lipases and nucleases*. Trypsinogen is activated by an enzyme, *enterokinase* secreted by the intestinal mucosa, into trypsin, which in turn activates other enzymes in the pancreatic juice. The bile released into the duodenum contains bile-pigments, *bilirubin* and *biliverdin*, bile salts, cholesterol and phospholipids but no enzymes. Bile helps in the emasculation of fats, *i.e.*, breaking down of the fats into very small micelles. Bule also activates lipases.

The intestinal mucosal epithelium has **goblet cells** which secrete mucus. The secretions of the brush border cell of the mucosa along with the secretions of the goblet cells constitute the intestinal juice or succus entericus. This juice contains varieties of enzymes like disaccharides, *e.g.*, *maltase*, dipeptidases, lipases, nucleosidases, etc. The mucus along with the bicarbonates from the pancreases protects the intestinal mucosa from acid as well as provide an alkaline medium, *pH 7.8*, for enzymatic activities. Sub-mucosal glands, *Brunner's glands*, also help in this.

Proteins proteoses and peptones, partially hydrolyzed proteins, in the chyme reaching the intestine are acted upon by the proteolytic enzymes of the pancreatic juice as given below:

![Proteins_Peptones_Proteoses_to_Dipeptides](/proteins_peptones_proteoses_to_dipeptides.png)

Carbohydrates in the chyme are hydrolyzed by pancreatic amylase into disaccharides.

![polysaccharides(starch)_to_diasaccharides](/polysaccharides(starch)_to_diasaccharides.png)

Fats are broken down by lipases with the help of bile into diglycerides and monoglycerides.

![fats_to_disaccharides_to_monosaccharides](/fats_to_disaccharides_to_monosaccharides.png)

Nucleases in the pancreatic juice acts on nucleic acids to form nucleotides and nucleosides.

![nucleic_acids_to_nucleotides_to_nucleosides](/nucleic_acids_to_nucleotides_to_nucleosides.png)

The enzymes in the succus entericus act on the end products of the above reactions to form the respective simple absorbable forms. These final steps in digestion occur very close to the mucosal epithelial cells of the intestine.

This breakdown of biomacromolecules mentioned above occurs in the duodenum region of the small intestine. The simple substances thus formed are absorbed in the jejunum and ileum regions of the small intestine. The undigested and unabsorbed substances are passed on to the large intestine.

No significant digestive activity occurs in the large intestine. The functions of large intestine are:

- Absorption of some water, minerals and certain drugs;
- Secretion of mucus which helps in adhering the waste, undigested, particles together and lubricating it for an easy passage.

The undigested, unabsorbed substances called faces enter into the caecum of the large intestine through the ileo-cecal valve, which prevents the back flow of the fecal matter. It is temporary stored in the rectum until defecation.

The activities of the gastro-intestinal tract are under neural and hormonal control for proper coordination of different parts. The sight, smell, or the presence of food in the oral cavity can stimulate the secretion of saliva. Gastric and intestinal secretions are also similarly stimulated by neural signals. The muscular activities of different parts of the alimentary canal can also be moderated by neural mechanisms, both local and through CNS, central nervous system. Hormonal control of the secretion of digestive juices is carried out by local hormones produced by the gastric and intestinal mucosa.

# Absorption of digested products

Absorption is the process by which the end products of digestion pass through the intestinal mucosa into the blood or lymph. It is carried out by active, passive or facilitated transport mechanisms. Small amounts of monosaccharides like glucose, amino acids and some electrolytes like chloride ions are generally absorbed by simple diffusion. The passage of these substances into the blood depends upon the concentration gradients. However, some substances like glucose and amino acids are absorbed with the help of carrier proteins. This mechanism is called the *facilitated transport*.

Transport of water depends upon the osmotic gradient. Active transport occurs against the concentration gradient and hence requires energy. Various nutrients like amino acids, monosaccharides like glucose, electrolytes like sodium ion are absorbed into the blood by this mechanism.

Fatty acids and glycerol being insoluble, cannot be absorbed into the blood. They are first incorporated into small droplets called *micelles* which move into the intestinal mucosa. They are re-formed into very small protein coated fat globules called chylomicrons which are transported into the lymph vessels, *lacteals*, of the villi. These lymph vessels ultimately release the absorbed substances into the blood stream.

Absorption of substances takes place in different parts of the alimentary canal, like mouth, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. However, *maximum absorption occurs in the small intestine*. A summary of absorption, their sites and absorbed products are given in the following table.

|Mouth|Stomach|Small Intestine|Large Intestine|
|---|---|---|---|
|Certain drugs coming in contact with the mucosa of mouth and lower side of the tongue are absorbed into the blood capillaries lining them.|Absorption of water, simple sugars, and alcohol etc. takes place.|Principle organ for absorption of nutrients. The digestion is completed here and the final products of digestion such as glucose, fructose, fatty acids, glycerol and amino acids are absorbed through the mucosa into the blood stream and lymph.|Absorption of water, some minerals and drugs take place.|

The absorbed substances finally reach the tissues which utilize them for their activities. This process is called *assimilation*.

The digestive wastes, solidified into coherent feces in the rectum indicate a natural reflux causing an urge or desire for its removal. The digestion of feces to the outside through the anal opening, *defecation*, is a voluntary process and is carried out by a mass peristaltic movement.


# Disorders of digestive system

The inflammation of the intestinal ailment due to bacteria or viral infection. The infections are also caused by the parasites of the intestine like tapeworm, roundworm, threadworm, hookworm, pin worm, etc.

## Jaundice

The liver is affected, skin and eyes turn yellow due to the deposit of bile pigment.

## Vomiting

It is the ejection of stomach contents through the mouth. This reflex action is controlled by the vomit center in the medulla oblongata. A feeling of nausea precedes vomiting.

## Diarrhea

The abnormal frequency of bowel movement and increased liquidity of the fecal discharge is known as diarrhea. It reduces the absorption of food.

## Constipation

In constipation, the faces are retained within the colon as the bowel movements occur irregularly.

## Indigestion

In this condition, the food is not properly digested leading to feeling of fullness. The causes of indigestion are inadequate enzyme secretion, anxiety, food poisoning, over eating, and spicy food.

## PEM

PEM stands for Protein-energy malnutrition. Dietary deficiencies of proteins and total food calories are widespread in many underdeveloped countries of South and South-east Asia, South America, and West and Central Africa. PEM may affect large sections of the population during drought, famine and political turmoil. This happened in Bangladesh during the liberation war and in Ethiopia during the severe drought in the mid-eighties. PEM affects infants and children to produce marasmus and Kwashiorkor.

### Marasmus

Marasmus is produced by a simultaneous deficiency of proteins and calories. It is found in infants less than a year in age, if mother's milk is replaced too early by other foods which are poor in both proteins and caloric value. This often happens if the mother has second pregnancy or childbirth when the older infant is still too young. In Marasmus, protein deficiency impairs growth and replacement of tissue proteins; extreme emaciation of the body and thinning of limbs results, the skin becomes dry, thin and wrinkled. Growth rate and body weight decline considerably. Even growth and development of brain and mental faculties are impaired.

### Kwashiorkor

Kwashiorkor is produced by protein deficiency unaccompanied by calorie deficiency. It results from the replacement of mother's milk by a high calorie-low protein diet in a child more than one year in age. Like marasmus, kwashiorkor shows wasting of muscles, thinning of limbs, failure of growth and brain development. But unlike marasmus, some fat is still left under the skin; moreover, extensive oedema and swelling of body parts are seen.
